The purpose of our project is to learn about MOBA games mechanisms in hero selection, how to predict the winning probability of the team given the team composition, which is composed by five different heroes; we would also show how our analysis, based on playerâ€™s heroes pool, can help the players to understand their potential performance given the heroes that the players selected.

As part of this project, we design and implement a predicting algorithm where the goal is to predict the adeptness (the KDA ratio) of a player given the selection of a hero, and therefore how the selection of hero can used to predict the winning probability. Later, we developed the prediction of winning chance based on the hero selection through the neural network. By choosing a moderate activation function we can select the one with the highest accuracy.
